# TODO list experiment  

* 2023-12-27:
** - this page is now an experiment in using Obsidian pages as Emacs `org-mode` files.  
** - from [Activation (The Org Manual) (orgmode.org)](https://orgmode.org/manual/Activation.html) the first step is to add a first line to the file that looks like this: `MY PROJECTS    -*- mode: org; -*-`

- this is now a page with a somewhat odd first line. and the first block (with the date) behaves as an `org-mode` outline in Emacs. I am assuming that `org-mode` will not be confused by these blocks of text.
