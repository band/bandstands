-*- mode: org; -*-
# TODO list experiment  

* 2023-12-27:
** - this page is now an experiment in using Obsidian pages as Emacs `org-mode` files.  
** - from [Activation (The Org Manual) (orgmode.org)](https://orgmode.org/manual/Activation.html) the first step is to add a first line to the file that looks like this: `MY PROJECTS    -*- mode: org; -*-`

- this is now a page with a somewhat odd first line. and the first block (with the date) behaves as an `org-mode` outline in Emacs. I am assuming that `org-mode` will not be confused by these blocks of text.

```

this is markdown text, yes?
Yes, it looks like it is rendered as such in Obsidian (i.e., it is
fenced)  .

** IN-PROGRESS experiment number 2

** VERIFYING works with `.md` file

:LOGBOOK:

- Note taken on [2023-12-31 Sun 13:49] \\

  adding a time-stamped note? yes?

- State "VERIFYING"  from "DONE"       [2023-12-29 Fri 16:56]

- State "DONE"       from "IN-PROGRESS" [2023-12-29 Fri 16:34]

:END:

  - only if `-*- mode: org; -*-` is the first line in the file

    then add in some Markdown for a header .... in fact, put whatever is not to be in an outline structure _before_ the first `org-mode` headline

  - there is some conflict between use of the asterisk in org-mode and Markdown

* Aha; that is how to headline  
:NOTAS:
and here we have una nota
:END:


  

* need to type to org the outline

:PROPERTIES:

height: 2

length: 3

area: ?

:END:

  

** this is nested, yes?

- cool, can keep each nest separated by blank lines

- but once outline starts, there is no inserting non-outlined text?

  

  

* once an outline, always an outline;

- who will rid me of this meddlesome outline?
