# 2023-04-26 Explore Gmail messages with OpenAI

From today's Massive Wiki Wednesday meet, with help from Peter Kaminski:

You:
I'd like to run Gmail messages through langchain and llama-index, using Python code and the Gmail API. Create a project plan for me. I'll need use Talon for parsing emails and stripping out quoted messages.

ChatGPT:
Project Plan: Gmail Messages Processing using Langchain, Llama-index, and Talon

Objective:
To create a Python application that uses the Gmail API to fetch messages, parses emails and strips out quoted messages using Talon, and runs the messages through Langchain and Llama-index.

Requirements:

1. Python 3.x
2. Gmail API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)
3. Langchain API key
4. Llama-index API key
5. Talon library

Steps:

1. Setup Development Environment:
   a. Install Python 3.x
   b. Create a virtual environment for the project
   c. Install necessary libraries and packages (google-api-python-client, google-auth-httplib2, google-auth-oauthlib, talon, requests)

2. Obtain API Credentials:
   a. Get Gmail API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) from Google Developer Console
   b. Register and obtain API keys for Langchain and Llama-index

3. Authenticate and Access Gmail API:
   a. Use Gmail API credentials to authenticate and authorize access to Gmail messages
   b. Implement a function to list and retrieve messages from the Gmail account

4. Parse Emails and Strip Quoted Messages with Talon:
   a. Create a function to parse the email messages using Talon library
   b. Implement email stripping to remove quoted messages from the email body

5. Process Emails with Langchain and Llama-index:
   a. Create a function to send email content to Langchain API and process it
   b. Implement another function to send the processed content to Llama-index API for further analysis

6. Integrate Components:
   a. Combine functions to create an automated workflow from fetching messages to processing them with Langchain and Llama-index
   b. Resolve potential errors and exceptions

7. Testing and Debugging:
   a. Test with a variety of email samples to ensure accurate parsing and processing
   b. Resolve issues found during testing

8. Documentation:
   a. Write documentation on how to set up and use the application
   b. Provide examples of use cases and sample outputs

9. Deployment and Maintenance:
   a. Package the application for easy deployment
   b. Plan for regular updates and maintenance to ensure compatibility with API changes and security updates
