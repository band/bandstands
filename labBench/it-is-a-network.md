# 2024-08-09 it is a network

// decentralized and an idiosyncratic federation /  
TODO: find shorter words.  
  - idiosyncratic: intrinsic, unique, distinctive  
  - decentralized: separated, inter-dependent and independent  
// in a graph nodes and links can have metadata /  
// nodes and links provide context information about each other and the relationships /  
// pick a network up by one node and shake it and you might represent a hierarchy /  
// wiki ways: pages and links amongst them /  
// inter wiki links: how to specify, how to support two-way linking /  
// how much metadata and property information can links carry? /  
// todo: find current thinking on the kinds of network, or graph, links /
