Reference lists and bibliographies  
A reference list (aka "Bibliography" or "Works Cited," depending on the style) is where you provide full information on each of the sources you've cited in the text. It appears at the end of your paper, usually with a hanging indent applied to each entry.  
The information included in reference entries is broadly similar, whatever citation style you're
using. For each source, you'll typically include the:  
• Author name  
• Title  
• Publication date  
• Container (e.g., the book an essay was published in, the journal an article appeared in)  
• Publisher  
• Location (e.g., a URL or DOl, or sometimes a physical location)  
The exact information included varies depending on the source type and the citation style. The
order in which the information appears, and how you format it (e.g., capitalization, use of italics)
also varies.  

 - perhaps mix APA and MLA format; review the Python script chatGPT generated.
