# 2023-08-09 project diary entry

Project futures; planning notes:

- focus on extracting topics from documents and collections of documents  
- use more than one framework (e.g., langchain, llama-index, ?)  
- use OpenAI and other models, including `huggingface` pipelines, `gpt4all`, ?  
- explore value of organizing `aipraxisLab` repository along model or framework axes (?)  
- set up three different document collections for testing  
- keep notes on Python setup details (`venv`, `pip`, what else?)  
- wrap-up individual experiments with notes and possibly put into separate folders  
- keep the lab benches clean, with only a few exp'ts going at a time (perfect use for a Kanban board); in fact, limit number of open exp'ts to three or fewer.


Peter Kaminsky suggestion from Massive Wiki Wednesday 2023-08-09 call:  

Idea for Category / Topic Mapping for Articles  
- have ChatGPT make a list of categories or topics  
    - then have it make sub-categories and sub-sub-categories, etc. as desired  
- have ChatGPT synthesize articles for the leaf categories  
- generate embeddings for the synthetic articles  
- do vector database matching with embeddings for real articles
