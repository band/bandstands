### Resources

 - LLM in a browser ([Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/)): "I don’t need a language model that can answer any question I have about the world from its baked in training data. I ~~need~~ want something that can manipulate language in useful ways. I care about summarization, and fact extraction, and answering questions about larger text."

 - What’s in the RedPajama-Data-1T LLM training set:

 - good documentation on using SimpleVectorIndex with a `service_context` and with inserting more content into the index:
	   [LlamaIndex Usage Pattern - LlamaIndex (gpt-index.readthedocs.io)](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/primer/usage_pattern.html)
	

- question answering over documents:

- and from reddit r/LocalLLaMA (the "prompt engineering" caution seems interesting)

    - this would be a better resource if the code was proof-read before posting. *sigh*
