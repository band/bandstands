# Donna Thomson - if there is anyone to remember

```
if there is anyone to remember
this time
will be remembered
we will be judged
rightly
for what we did not do
i saw it once
in a waking dream
seven years ago
the river's region
from above
vast
all brown and dry
burnt
by drought and fire
we wept together
she and i
and now again
we weep together
my tears are not for her
rather
for the blindness
of humans
nero fiddled
we argue and deny
refuse to surrender
our self-assigned position
at the center of the universe
spirit sings a funeral dirge
haunting
beautiful and sad
i hear it daily
they are leaving
leaving us
to the consequences of our actions
returning home
spirit of tree and water
bow before the fire
and disappear
into other worlds
where they are known
and welcomed
oh river oh waters of the world
ancient trees
if i had the words
and knew the song
would sing for you
for all we are losing
as it is
my tears must serve
as my honoring
my offering
my hope
we will awaken
and spirit will return
```
