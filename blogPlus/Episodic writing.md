# Episodic writing

Ideas about a writing form (maybe called **Episodes**) mentioned by Lewis Hyde in _A Primer for Forgetting_[^1] and a proposal.
#### Excerpts from pages 4-5:  

> “As for the form, … build on my scrapbooks rather than mine their content ….”

> “…. make a book whose free associations are happily fore-grounded, a book that does not so much argue its point of departure as more simply sketch the territory I have been exploring, a book I hope will both invite and provoke a reader’s own free reflections.”

> “… citations, aphorisms. anecdotes, stories, and reflections … are the stuff of my episodic form ….”


### Episode properties  
- TITLE: this text is found somewhere in the "episode" ....  
- LENGTH: is a free property. Maybe use this length idea from [[Berlant and Stewart - The Hundreds]]  
- No need to finish out every last idea or connection. Leave some room for the reader to think about it ....
