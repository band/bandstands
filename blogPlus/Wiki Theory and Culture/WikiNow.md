## WikiNow

_part of [[Wiki Theory and Culture]]_

[WikiNow](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/WikiNow)  describes and illustrates how a wiki page can contain a topic and build in the conversation that embodies that topic.

  > One benefit of the [WikiNow](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/WikiNow) is that there is always _more_ time. On a wiki, it may not matter whether you respond in an hour or a month. Two weeks is rarely important. Moreover, if you can't think of something to say, or if you forget to say something, someone in the future may say it. Conversations can last years, can be dropped by individuals, and can be picked up by others. That's not to say that being lazy is the way to go. Like anything, human attention spans are small. If _nothing_ happens for a long period of time, people are likely to forget or stop caring. However, on a wiki, there is less pressure than on a [WebLog](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/WebLog) to respond quickly. Taking time to consider your response is encouraged. No such thing as a [FirstPost](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/FirstPost) here.
