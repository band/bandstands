## Link As You Think
   
The core essence of Wikis: the ability to **Link As You Think** by simply typing the page name. What makes this feature beautiful is that you can link to a page that does not already exist. 

To link to a page on a Wiki, you refer to the page's name. This is different from the default behavior of the web, which usually requires that you track down a URL (usually designed for machines, not people) to create a link.

The ability to point to a page that does not currently exist is a powerful capability. [Ward Cunningham](https://web.archive.org/web/20100612154846/http://blueoxen.net/w/index.php?title=Ward_Cunningham&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1), who invented the [WikiWikiWeb](https://web.archive.org/web/20100612154846/http://blueoxen.net/wiki/WikiWikiWeb), originally observed this behavior when he was doing software design with index cards. He noticed that engineers would place a card on the table without writing anything on it and talk about it as if it was a real entity, even though it had not yet been named or described.
