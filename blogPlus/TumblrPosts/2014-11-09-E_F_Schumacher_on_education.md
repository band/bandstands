Every now and then I look back on notes I have made. Here's a 40-year
old gem:

"When people ask for education they normally mean something more than
mere training, something more than mere knowledge of facts, something
more than a mere diversion. Maybe they cannot themselves formulate
precisely what they are looking for; but I think what they are really
looking for is ideas that would make the world, and their own lives,
intelligible to them. When a thing is intelligible, you have a sense of
participation..."

E.F. Schumacher
Small Is Beautiful (1973), p. 77.
