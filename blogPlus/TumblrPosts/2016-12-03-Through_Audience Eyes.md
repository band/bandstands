> The artist and her audience can have an interactive relationship that
> will build knowledge on both sides.
>
> Here is a question that was posted on Quora:
>
> *Why are artist who are good don't think they are good at drawing?
> People who usually see my work think I am a good artist; but I don't
> feel the same way-when they think it is perfect I always think I could
> have done better than I did.*
>
> Teacher Reflection:
> As a professional art teacher it is important to help the student see
> from many angles. One angle is through the eyes of her audience to
> understand what the art is communicating to the viewer. In this
> example, the audience offers feedback that the artist disagrees with.
> Can overpraise hurt an artist? Yes, it can call a halt to creativity
> because if the artist wants to please the audience, the artist simply
> repeats the successful strategy. However, if the artist respects the
> audience, a lot can be learned by asking questions back, such as, "Why
> do you feel that way about this piece?" By continuing the conversation
> you deepen your creative learning.
>
> Here is my answer posted on Quora to help the artist put audience
> praise in context:
>
> *Art making is a process that never ends. So, as an artist, you see
> your works as part of your process that is always evolving. Others
> however, see each of your works as finished products. Drawings are
> rarely finished products for an artist. Drawing is a way of getting
> ideas out of your head to work into a painting, sculpture, design,
> character, fashion, etc. It is rather rare that drawing is meant to be
> an end product. Artists see a vision of the end product with the
> drawings as steps toward that product. The goal of each piece of art
> is not perfection. A key goal of drawings is to lay the groundwork for
> the next step in your creative life. If other people get joy from your
> steps along the way, listen to your audience and ask what specifically
> they find successful in your work. They may give you insights into
> your strengths.*
