The one legacy of Freud, Jung, and the many other psychoanalysts that
keeps popping up for me is  the practice of listening to what comes to
mind first. These first thoughts are often unexpected  associations that
lead me to new connections among ideas I thought I understood.

At one conference a couple of years ago I restricted my note taking
during presentations to  writing haiku structured summaries of what
struck me as the main point. It helped me listen with  both sides of my
brain. I'm thinking that free associating gives me access to more of my
mind.
