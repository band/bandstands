My son gave me ["Life of Pi" by Yann
Martel](http://books.google.com/books?id=HASjGAAACAAJ) for Christmas in
2008. I found it an engaging novel. The pace of the story fits the
storyline, and it's filled with reflections on religion, living with
animals, and learning from experience. Two quotes from different parts
of the story stuck with me.

This first one reminded me of my own education, both early and ongoing.

"It was my luck to have a few good teachers in my youth, men and women
who came into my dark head and lit a match."

This second one touched me because I am now living with a young dog and
slowly coming to understand that it's a different species and how easily
my unconscious human behaviors can be frightening.

"What you don't realize is that we are a strange and forbidding species
to wild animals. We fill them with fear. They avoid us as much as
possible. It took centuries to still the fear in some pliable animals --
*domestication* it's called -- but most cannot get over their fear, and
I doubt they ever will. When wild animals fight us, it is out of sheer
desperation. They fight when they feel they have no other way out. It's
a very last resort."
