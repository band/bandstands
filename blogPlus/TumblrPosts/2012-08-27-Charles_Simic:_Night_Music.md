One of the best new poems I have read.

**Night Music**Â  by Charles Simic

```
Little brook, running past my house,
I like the tune you hum to yourself
When night comes,
And only the two of us are awake.
You keep me company
So I don't fear
The darkness round my bed
And the thoughts in my head
Flying crookedly like bats
Between the old church and the graveyard.
```

*This poem appeared in the September 13, 2012 issue of The New Republic
magazine.*
