Matthew Battles has an engaging and informative blog post in the New
York Times titled [How Writers Interact With the
World](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/how-writers-interact-with-the-world/).

The post helped me think about writing, but one of the comments
(reproduced below) on this post made me laugh and think about the
specific activity and results of writing.

You don't do 'data entryon a manual Underwood. You just type on
old-fashioned paper. And when you're done, it doesn't matter how many
keys you push, it won't tell you a thing. It just sits there like a cat
and stares at you.
