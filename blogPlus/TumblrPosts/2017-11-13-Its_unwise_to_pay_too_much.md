Cleaning out a file cabinet I found this quote in folder of software
engineering miscellany. It is attributed to [John
Ruskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ruskin){.markup--anchor

"It's unwise to pay too much, but it's worse to pay too little. When you
pay too much, you lose a little money --- that's all. When you pay too
little, you sometimes lose everything, because the thing you bought was
incapable of doing the thing it was bought to do.

The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting
a lot. It can't be done. If you deal with the lowest bidder, it is well
to add something for the risk you run. And if you do that, you will have
enough to pay for something better."
