mentioned this last blog post by Andrew Olmstead, the first soldier
killed in Iraq in 2008 (Andrew was killed on January 3, 2008). Andrew
kept a blog with the very droll title:Â 

> Obsidian Wings
> "This is the Voice of Moderation. I wouldn't go so far as to say we've
> actually SEIZED the radio station ... "

[This blog post](http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2008/01/andy-olmsted.html) is one that he wrote and asked to be posted in the event of his death.  Andrew Olmstead's voice is powerful and worth reading ... more than once.
