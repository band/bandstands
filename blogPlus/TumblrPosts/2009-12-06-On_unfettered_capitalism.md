In a [letter to the New
Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/letters/2009/12/07/091207mama_mail4)
on a review of a biography of Ayn Rand, Lisa Turner writes,
"[C]apitalism, in its most extreme form, is the mirror image of
Communism---cold, inhuman, inhumane, intractably greedy, and full of
contempt for the individual, as well as for societal ideals as a whole."
I agree.
