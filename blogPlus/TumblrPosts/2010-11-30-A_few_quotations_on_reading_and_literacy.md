## Title:  A few quotations on reading and literacy
Date: 2010-11-30

I am aware that quotations found on the Internet are more than likely
wrong, or wrongly attributed, or both. That said, last night I found a
few that I really like here: <http://www.literacyla.org/quotes.htm>
[N.B.: the attributions have not been verified.]

"Books are the quietest and most constant of friends, they are the most
accessible and wisest of councilors, and the most patient of teachers."
-Charles W. Eliot

"We shouldn't teach great books; we should teach a love of reading."
- B. F. Skinner

"Research is the process of going up alleys to see if they are blind."
- Marston Bates

"What's important is that all human knowledge be made available to all
intelligent people who want to learn it."
- Stephen Jay Gould
