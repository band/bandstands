"Nobody believes in evolution. You either understand evolution or you
don't. There is nothing to believe. It's something to perceive ..."

2012-08-09 update: this was first posted on another blog on June 20,
2011. I thought the observation akin to saying "Nobody believes in
arithmetic. You either understand arithmetic or you don't." And I still
think that. But when I bought the new edition of this album a few months
ago I found that this particular lyric missing. Clearly "belief" is a
complex topic.
