between Sarah Palin and Paul Ryan? Lipstick."

Snark can be fun, and maybe even provides a neuro-chemical hit, but it
can not lead to better discourse. I need ways to talk with those with
whom I have disagreements. And an ad hominem zinger is not going to lead
to rational dialog. It just promotes more us versus them thinking. And
in my experience that way of thinking is a dead end. I need to find a
viewpoint and (rhetorical?) stance that acknowledges our
interdependence. We really are in this life together.
