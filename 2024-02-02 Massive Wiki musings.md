# 2024-02-02 Massive Wiki musings

/ recent conversations regarding Massive Wiki are about publishing //  
/ noted: [[flancian]] use of `makefiles` //  
/ interest in "sharing versioned files" seems to have waned //  
/ what does a Massive Wiki backend provide that is not provided by other tools, apps, and solutions? //  
/ my own interest is focusing on sharing and inter-linking amongst other collections //  
/ notice: trying to avoid using the word "content" (mentioned somewhere on the socials) //  
/ maybe [[flancian]]'s work on [[angora]] is worth focusing on //  
/ i am reminded of an earlier observation that "wikis are people sorters" //  

/ what i want: separate home page; minimal CSS; is that it? //
