## Chapter One
*Melanie Klein as a Social Theorist?*

Page 21:

> Whereas Freud saw the group as modeled on the authoritarian love of the family, a Kleinian perspective sees the group as defending against primitive anxiety. The problem with groups is that they are so good at defending against this anxiety that they forestall ==the emotional conflicts that lead to moral learning==.
