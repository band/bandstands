# 2025-10-02 Paris Review notes

some excerpts and notes from The Paris Review, Fall 2025

#### The Art of the Essay No. 4: Eliot Weinberger
page 71: (responding to critics who suspect that what he writes is not strictly factual)  
> ... I did include a bibliography in _An Elemental Thing_, to show that everything in my essays comes from somewhere, and that whether or not we would consider the information true is not the point -- _somebody_ believed it.  

page 77:  
> ... my vision of the world was completely formed by _Mad_ magazine. _Mad_ was the only place that told the children of the fifties, Your parents are idiots, your teacher is an idiot, the president is an idiot, and the Lone Ranger is a racist. The ideological bedrock of the sixties counterculture is not Marx or Mao, but _Mad_.

#### The Art of Nonfiction No. 13: Maggie Nelson
page 149: (responding to a question about _The Argonauts_)  
> There needed to be connections along the way, and a rising sense of stakes, to make it interesting not just as writing but as a series of thoughts.  

(responding to a question about her work consisting of arranging)  
> ... If _Bluets_ and _The Argonauts_ work, it's because of the plotting that's not visible, the order in which information is dispensed.

page 156:  
> ... There's a push and pull between being a good observer and asking, What is the rhythm of my attention telling me about myself?

\[ this seems right in line with [[Hospicing Modernity]] and the exercises suggested about getting to know the world I inhabit, create, and then re-inhabit;-- maybe that itself is a habit? \]
