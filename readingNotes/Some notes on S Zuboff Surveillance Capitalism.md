page 10:

> Surveillance capitalism's products and services are not the objects of a value exchange. ... We are not surveillance capitalism's "customers". Although the saying tells us "It it's free, then you are the product," that is also incorrect. We are the sources of surveillance capitalism's crucial surplus: the objects of a technologically advanced and increasingly inescapable raw-material-extraction operation. Surveillance capitalism's actual customers are the enterprises that trade in its markets for future behavior.  

> In a modern capitalist society, technology was, is, and always will be an expression of the economic objectives that direct it into action. ...  

> We are not alone in falling prey to the technology illusion. It is an enduring theme of social thought, as old as the Trojan horse. Despite this, each generation stumbles into the quicksand of forgetting that technology is an expression of other interests. In modern times this means the interests of capital, and in our time it is surveillance capital that commands the digital milieu and directs our trajectory toward the future.
