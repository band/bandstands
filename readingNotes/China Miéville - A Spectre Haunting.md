Epigraph:  
> When someone asked me what communism was, i opened my mouth to answer, then realised i didn't have the faintest idea. My image of a communist came from a cartoon.... We're taught at such an early age to be against communists, yet most of us don't have the faintest idea what communism is. ==Only a fool lets somebody else tell him who his enemy is.==
