> There was a widespread rejection of the pre-war political systems. In Poland the underground government and therefore its press was run by members of the pre-war opposition parties who strove to develop programmes which would move Poland back towards a liberal democracy. ...  
> Not all governments-in-exile were happy that the resistance was discussing the shape of future government. Radio Free Belgium criticized _La Voix des Belges_ for such conduct. In response a clandestine newspaper warned the government:  
>   "When you return, you will find us older and that we have endured much. You have not been able to follow the evolution of the people for four years. You will meet men (sic) transformed by ... fighting ... who have learned to show themselves intransigent ... you have not suffered under the Nazis nor seen the traitors in action."

> The principal challenge facing Rowecki when setting up the ZWZ \[Union for Armed Struggle\] was uniting under his command the over 100 underground military organizations that had emerged after Poland's defeat. He confided to his deputy Bór-Komorowski:

All I have is the authority of the Polish Government abroad, and this is of necessity a moral authority only, and the future alone can show whether it is sufficiently strong to overcome political differences as well as personal ambitions and unite the whole nation.
