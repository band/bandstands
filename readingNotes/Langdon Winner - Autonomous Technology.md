## Introduction

Pages 11-12: (apparatus, technique, and organization)

>I shall offer some basic definitions that I will be using in my writing here.
>
>First I want to note the class of objects we normally refer to as technological -- tools, instruments, machines, appliances, weapons, gadgets -- which are used in accomplishing a wide variety of tasks. In speaking of objects of this sort I shall employ the term *apparatus*. For many persons, "technology" actually means apparatus, that is, the physical devices of technical performance.
>
  I also want to mark the whole body of technical activities -- skills, methods, procedures, routines -- that people engage in to accomplish tasks and include such activities under the rubric *technique*. The root of this word is the Greek *technÄ“* ("art," "craft," or "skill"), which linguists have further traced to the Indo-European root *teks-* ("to weave or fabricate"). From the earliest times, technique has been distinguished from other modes of human action by its purposive, rational step-by-step way of doing things.
  >
  In addition "technology" frequently refers to some (but not all) varieties of social organization -- factories, 
  workshops, bureaucracies, armies, research and development teams, and the like. For my uses here, the term *organization* will signify all varieties of technical (rational-productive) social arrangements. Another closely related term -- network -- will mark those large-scale systems that combine people and apparatus linked across great distances.
