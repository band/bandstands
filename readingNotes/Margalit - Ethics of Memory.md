> What concerns me, however, is not the healing powers of knowing the truth in the case of the individual but the healing power of knowing the truth in the case of communal memories.

> ... to know is to believe something to be true. Memory, then, is _knowledge from the past_. It is not necessarily knowledge _about the past_.  

page 183:  
> ... my ethics and morality are humanistic, not religious. This means that the sources of their justification lie in humans, and not in any "higher" beings.  

page 184:
