My review: Harari is concerned about the current adoption of new AI systems (LLMs and AGIs). He argues that information networks is a useful frame with which to examine the potential impacts on current human societies of AI system adoption. He examines other human information networks that have supported religion, education, governance in the past and the present. He comes down hard on institutions like religions and bureaucracies.  
The excerpts below are what I underlined while reading (page numbers are from the ebook version I purchased). They are not a summary of his argument.  

page 5:  
> What do the cautionary fables of the \[sorcerer's\] apprentice and of Phaethon tell us in the twenty-first century? ... The fables offer no answers. ... \[They\] encourage people to abdicate responsibility and put their faith in gods and sorcerers ....
> The tendency to create powerful things with unintended consequences started not with the invention of the steam engine or AI but with the invention of religion.  
> ... The Phaethon myth and Goethe's poem fail to provide useful advice because they mis-construe the way humans gain power. ....  human power is never the outcome of individual initiative. Power always stems from cooperation between large numbers of humans.  
> ... The main argument of this book is that humankind gains enormous power by building large networks of cooperation, but the way those networks are built predisposes us to use that power unwisely. Our problem, then, is a network problem.
