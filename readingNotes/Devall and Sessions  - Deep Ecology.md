**PREFACE**  

The environmental problems of technocratic-industrial societies are beginning to be seen as manifestations of what some individuals are calling "the continuing environmental crisis." This is coming to be understood as a crisis of character and of culture.

The environmental/ecology social movements of the twentieth century have been one response to the continuing crisis. These movements have addressed some of the problems and have tried to reform some of the laws and agencies which manage the land and to change some of the attitudes of people in these societies. But more than just reform is needed. Many philosophers and theologians are calling for a new ecological philosophy for our time.

We believe, however, that we may not need something new, but need to reawaken something very old, to reawaken our understanding of Earth wisdom. In the broadest sense, we need to accept the invitation to the dance-the dance of unity of humans, plants, animals, the Earth. We need to cultivate an ecological consciousness. And we believe that a way out of our present predicament may be simpler than many people realize.

Responding to the environmental crisis, the themes in Deep Ecology alternate between personal, individual options and public policy and collective options. On the personal level, we encourage introspection, purification and harmony, and a dancing celebration or affirmation of all being. On the level of intellectual, historical analysis, the book offers an examination of the dominant worldview in our society, which has led directly to the continuing crisis of culture. We then present an ecological, philosophical, spiritual approach for dealing with the crisis.

On the level of public or community policies, we examine various conventional approaches to natural resource management, criticize these approaches and present realistic alternatives. A major thrust of the book is an intellectual examination of the predicament and an attempt to clarify our vital needs as humans.

To readers who feel we live in the best of all possible worlds, with a high standard of living, the book suggests an alternative perspective to consider. To professional philosophers, resource managers and politicians who deal with ideas, abstractions, ethical theory, economics and politics, the book suggests some of the limitations, in our view, of the dominant approach to public policy. To the reader seeking a more authentic existence and integrity of character, the book offers a theory of direct action which can help develop maturity.

In structure, the book begins with a chapter on possible scenarios for the environmental/ecology movement during the next several decades.  We suggest an approach based on asking deeper questions and on cultivating ecological consciousness. In chapter two we discuss the minority tradition of culture and community and specific types of direct action which individuals can take to further serve their own vital needs while serving the needs of the larger community of other humans, plants, animals, and the Earth. Chapter three summarizes the dominant world- view and its critics. In chapter four we discuss the reformist response to the dominant worldview, in both philosophy and reform politics.

Chapter five presents the basic intuitions, ultimate norms, and principles of deep ecology. In chapter six, various sources of deep ecological insights and philosophical principles are introduced. Chapter seven discusses the vital need humans have for wilderness and the public policy decisions now affecting the remaining wild places of the Earth.

In chapter eight we confront the real problems of managing natural resources in technocratic-industrial societies and suggest some proposals for management from a deep ecology perspective. The importance of ecotopian visions is presented in chapter nine along with a review of several ecotopian statements by prominent writers.

Chapter ten presents a theory of taking direct action to further the development of maturity based on theories of psycho-social develop- ment. The final chapter returns to the theme of direct action, and dis- cusses ecological resisting - the affirmation of life based on deep eco- logical insights and principles.

Deep Ecology is an invitation to thinking, and presents challenging questions and dilemmas. To help in developing personal insights into deep ecology, brief writings from many authors have been included. These stimulating insights, perceptions, and debates can be read independent of the text. We encourage the reader to read the book creatively by bridging the ideas in the boxed writings and the text.

_Taken in its entirety, the increase in mankind's strength has brought about a decisive, many-sided shift in the balance of strength between man and the earth. Nature, once a harsh and feared master, now lies in subjection, and needs protection against man's powers. Yet because man, no matter what intellectual and technical heights he may scale, remains embedded in nature, the balance has shifted against him, too, and the threat that he poses to the earth is a threat to him as well._
 -Jonathan Schell, The Fate of the Earth (1982)

CANDLES IN BABYLON  

_Through the midnight streets of Babylon
between the steel towers of their arsenals,
between the torture castles with no windows,
we race by barefoot, holding tight
our candles, trying to shield
the shivering flames, crying
"Sleepers Awake!"
                  hoping
the rhyme's promise was true,
that we may return
from this place of terror
home to a calm dawn and
the work we had just begun._  
- _Denise Levertov_, Candles in Babylon
