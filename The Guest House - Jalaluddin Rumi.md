# The Guest House - Jalaluddin Rumi:

(Translated by Coleman Barks)

This being human is a guest house.  
Every morning a new arrival.  

A joy, a depression, a meanness,  
some momentary awareness comes  
as an unexpected visitor.  

Welcome and entertain them all!  
Even if they're a crowd of sorrows,  
who violently sweep your house  
empty of its furniture,  
still, treat each guest honorably.  
He may be clearing you out  
for some new delight.   

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,  
meet them at the door laughing,  
and invite them in.  

Be grateful for whoever comes,  
because each has been sent  
as a guide from beyond.  

**Jalaluddin Rumi**
