- Excerpt:  
The University of Hawaiʻi is partnering with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to collect critical atmospheric measurements on Maunakea that are vital to understanding how Earth’s climate is changing. NOAA scientists recently installed an intake tube less than an inch in diameter and 25 feet long on the UH 88 inch observatory to sample the summit air after data collection on Maunaloa* was abruptly disabled when lava from the Maunaloa eruption cut off staff access and power lines to NOAA’s Mauna Loa* Observatory (MLO). Atmospheric measurements have been taken on Maunaloa since 1958 providing more than six decades of data to track global climate change through CO2 measurements.

The NOAA team also worked with UH scientists to install a separate small intake tube on the existing weather monitoring station on Maunakea for CO2 measurements by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego. NOAA and Scripps scientists make independent measurements of CO2 at Maunaloa.
