**Primary task**: connections between the neoliberal, capitalist market system, the current nation states of the world, and isolated and melancholy individualism seem numerous, and worthy of some exposition. These notes are a start at collecting resources and thinking. (My intent is to populate this wiki page with relevant links, comments, and free associations, and more(?).)  

[[Akwaeke Emezi - revolutionary imagination]]  
... It’s a revolution against violent white institutions—police, prisons, the patriarchal family—but, just as importantly, it’s an uprising against white ways of being. The revolution will be ontological or it will be bullshit.

[[2022-07-08 notes on social defenses in organizations]]  
... How new structures and work methods will interact with individual’s anxieties and whether they can be used to promote creativity and depressivity rather than institutionalize more primitive relations is a question of great import. (Krantz, p. 4)

2023-06-08: Orna Guralnik, et al. papers and discussion of psychoanalysis and socio-politics. I was led to this work from this New York Times Magazine article: [I'm a Couples Therapist.

2023-08-11: Reading in [[Martha Nussbaum - Upheavals of thought]] about her thinking of what the primitive emotions are for human infants. It is based on [[object relations]] and associated psycho-analytic notions. One current take-away for me is that our adult behavior is never free from our primary emotional and material experiences as infants. And as adults we learn to manage our primitive feelings of anxiety and aggression and live in the social systems we construct. We (I) must be aware of how today's world-wide anxiety can provoke infantile emotions and lead to maladaptive behaviors and outcomes.

[[2023-09-16 Bandy Lee - psychic contagion]]  
...  Carl Jung warned against the menace of "psychic epidemics." Sigmund Freud explained the lurking, unconscious perils behind "civilization". And as Erich Fromm famously noted: "That millions of people share the same forms of mental pathology does not make these people sane." ...

 - The alternative is to follow the path of the Soviet Union: sidelining experts and sacrificing lives.   

[[Jacqueline Rose - The Plague]]  
"Only if you admit your ambivalence even towards those you love most is there the faintest chance that you will reach out across the world to everyone .... There is a limit to how much we can psychically tolerate. This remains the fundamental insight of psychoanalysis, never more needed than today."
