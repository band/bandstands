# Zeitgeist notes

Primary task: connections between the neoliberal, capitalist market system, the current nation states of the world, and isolated and melancholy individualism seem numerous, and worthy of some exposition. These notes are a start at collecting resources and thinking. (My intent is to populate this wiki page with relevant links, comments, and free associations, and more(?).)

2023-06-08: Orna Guralnik, et al. papers and discussion of psychoanalysis and socio-politics. I was led to this work from this New York Times Magazine article: [I'm a Couples Therapist. Something New is Happening in Relationships](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/magazine/couples-therapy-orna-guralnik.html?unlocked_article_code=SrhQ0W_pQmmGW9pFFD2UFnf4PUoXNpARLrfaDSignktViv_udZutMk7t5z4cALGUp1sxwNbwSHHOJ1z3AqU9pjlNVGLJA-YXrcmJ8O1S6IH9UWUkOkcxplBY6cuy9ptkyUHd5Lg7ctRpGVkuM4sEM5r2fIqaR5jFnTYp0VN8XBf3VtogvI-_tIw6IXYlIyH_MF339-WBbb5EPTWTbTBYfCVQWRY0OQNxDroctr58VR6vHJo74TbnWt2GRv1H1uB1lT5n_FnXjD-BJLr9cQsmimlWAbATOo9Whp-DTQ4-KiWaJ1-D5YsyiNsy5Ro2500P34QmCEWH-wlsCeiW5Lyzy54y9Top_8CJ&smid=url-share)  (sorry for the long link, but maybe it allows access?)  

2023-08-11: Reading in [[Martha Nussbaum - Upheavals of thought]] about her thinking of what the primitive emotions are for human infants. It is based on [[object relations]] and associated psycho-analytic notions. One current take-away for me is that our adult behavior is never free from our primary emotional and material experiences as infants. And as adults we learn to manage our primitive feelings of anxiety and aggression and live in the social systems we construct. We (I) must be aware of how today's world-wide anxiety can provoke my infantile emotions and lead to mal-adaptive behaviors and outcomes.
