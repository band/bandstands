# 2022-10-02 why folders or attributes

In 1992 [[Bill Kent]] published a short essay titled ["Attributes? Why?"](http://www.bkent.net/Doc/whyatt.htm) that I want to re-read and maybe understand better. For many years I have held the view that there are two primary properties when talking about data elements, namely, kinship relations or attribute relations. This notion is from a 1967 paper by George Mealy "Another Look at Data" (citation req'd). (Looking at Mealy's theory of data leads to further thinking about relations and attributes.)

Kent's first claim in the essay is:  
> Things in object models should be there for useful reasons.

And I have read the piece to the end and remain confused. I am thinking about this in a wrong way. But Kent does distinguish between stored data and object specifications. So this note is about computation, but I need more context for his ideas about the use or even need of attributes.
