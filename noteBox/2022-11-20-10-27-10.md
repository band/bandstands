Samuel Hammond 🌐🏛 (@hamandcheese): 2) EAs love to debate normative ethics.

But where do abstract moral concepts derive their motivational power?

What resources do we draw upon to know if or when to reject a vulgar utilitarian calculus?

And if those resources always existed, what's the theory for, exactly? https://twitter.com/hamandcheese/status/1594360008023719939/photo/1

Samuel Hammond 🌐🏛 (@hamandcheese): 3) As Charles Taylor points out, the pragmatic force of morality exists prior to whatever framework it’s couched in. 

It's instead built up from concrete social practices.

So why not ditch the moral gerrymandering and argue for a principle directly from what grounds it? https://twitter.com/hamandcheese/status/1594362275393044482/photo/1
