# 2025-09-08 Hospicing Modernity notes
(HM == Hospicing Modernity)  

/ HM practice is beyond theory //  
/ @PK - yes transformation even beyond transformation //  
/ "... one of modernity's most effective weapons: its insistence that it has rendered other forms of knowledge obsolete. - page 20: Ghosh, A. (2016). _The Great Derangement: climate change and the unthinkable_. University of Chicago Press." //  
/ @Jerry - we are all "Muggles" - yes? //  
/ looking for a story, or stories, that will capture our attention and energy: this is the work of Modernity to save itself //  
/ my HM work cannot be about "finding", "searching", or "making sense"; i have to put all that down //
