Simon Wardley ❤️🇺🇦 @swardley@unwashed.plebs (@swardley): X :  Are "public goods" to the right of "utility"?
Me : It's an interesting idea. We commodify something (social -> economic value), we then commoditise it, then we decommodify it (economic -> social value). I only know how to map the bit in the middle. https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1549865541233516560/photo/1

Simon Wardley ❤️🇺🇦 @swardley@unwashed.plebs (@swardley): The bit in the middle depends upon supply and demand competition in all its forms (conflict, co-operation and collaboration). It's how I built the evolution curve which underpins mapping ... https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1549866284044750848/photo/1

Simon Wardley ❤️🇺🇦 @swardley@unwashed.plebs (@swardley): ... outside of this middle, what drives social or common goods is not something I can comment on with any confidence.

Simon Wardley ❤️🇺🇦 @swardley@unwashed.plebs (@swardley): X : Can't you just add columns?
Me : No. Mapping is built on the basic forms of competition. Everything from the economic patterns to the doctrine work in this space. I can't tell you what happens when you cross those boundaries into spaces which may be driven by other forces.

Simon Wardley ❤️🇺🇦 @swardley@unwashed.plebs (@swardley): X : But you have maps of values.
Me : When competition exists between collectives with different values. There is an evolution of values and that can be mapped. Competition takes many forms and not all is economic. However, are there spaces before (social) and after (commons)?

Simon Wardley ❤️🇺🇦 @swardley@unwashed.plebs (@swardley): X : Spaces without competition?
Me : Yes. I don't see why not. I don't know how you would map it. Hence I cheat and just acknowledge that we should consider turning utilities into common goods or point to the genesis of a new thing having an origin in social goods such as ideas.

Simon Wardley ❤️🇺🇦 @swardley@unwashed.plebs (@swardley): X : You can't map ideas?
Me : I can map ideas in competition with other ideas i.e .the evolution of science from concept to becoming accepted but there is some form of competition driving evolution (i.e. our learning about it). I don't know how to map outside of competition ...

Simon Wardley ❤️🇺🇦 @swardley@unwashed.plebs (@swardley): Me : ... i.e. how to map out the dream you had. I have no idea how to do that. I also have no idea how to map out the idea of mapping out the dream you had. I can map mapping but I can't map that. https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1549873168973807622/photo/1

Simon Wardley ❤️🇺🇦 @swardley@unwashed.plebs (@swardley): X : Well, it's not perfect then.
Me : Never said it was. My form of mapping is imperfect (being a map) and wrong (being a model) but It's good enough to be useful for many. There will be things outside of mapping, it has its limits.

Simon Wardley ❤️🇺🇦 @swardley@unwashed.plebs (@swardley): X : You cheat?
Me : Yes i.e. I talk about acting as seed funding to encourage genesis (from social goods) or talk about nationalisation (to a common good) but that's the limit of the map. https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1549876574849228800/photo/1

Simon Wardley ❤️🇺🇦 @swardley@unwashed.plebs (@swardley): X : Most Gov goods are common goods.
Me : No, most Govs are in competition with each other. They are not common to everyone. You can map that. What you should be looking for are areas where there is or should be no competition i.e. in global supranational treaties

Simon Wardley ❤️🇺🇦 @swardley@unwashed.plebs (@swardley): X : Examples.
Me : The atmosphere should be a global common good without the need for competition (conflict, co-operation, collaboration etc).
X : We do collaborate on the atmosphere.
Me ; We collaborate trying to stop people using the atmosphere as a private dustbin ...

Simon Wardley ❤️🇺🇦 @swardley@unwashed.plebs (@swardley): ... we shouldn't be polluting a common good in the way we are ... period. We forget it's not just our commons but the future's commons. We don't own it but we treat like it's our own garbage can - see also land, oceans.
