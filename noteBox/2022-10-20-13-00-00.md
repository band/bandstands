Yvonne Lam (@yvonnezlam): I'm having a week, thanks to technosolutionist masculine drivel, so I'm going to remind everyone that it's worth thinking about infrastructure as a relation (involving an actor/pov and a thing) and link to one of my favorite Susan Leigh Star papers:

Yvonne Lam (@yvonnezlam): Because all of tech is caught up in that same (lazy) technosolutionist masculine drivel, we end up not talking about the power relation inherent in declaring something to be infrastructure: what gets made invisible to whom, which means what and who gets rewarded/supported.

Yvonne Lam (@yvonnezlam): In the large, infrastructural work is *work that needs to be done* so that other work can happen. I am a feminist, so I'm willing to reframe the questions as "How we care for the people who do it? How do we care for infrastructural systems? How do we support negotiation...

Yvonne Lam (@yvonnezlam): ...between infrastructural concerns and product concerns?" Yes, who wants to do what matters, but so does why, which means system incentives matter too.
