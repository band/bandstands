Excerpt from [The Quantum Thermodynamics Revolution](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-quantum-thermodynamics-revolution-20170502/)

In his 1824 book, *Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire*, the 28-year-old French engineer Sadi Carnot worked out a formula for how efficiently steam engines can convert heat — now known to be a random, diffuse kind of energy — into work, an orderly kind of energy that might push a piston or turn a wheel. To Carnot’s surprise, he discovered that a perfect engine’s efficiency depends only on the difference in temperature between the engine’s heat source (typically a fire) and its heat sink (typically the outside air). Work is a byproduct, Carnot realized, of heat naturally passing to a colder body from a warmer one.

Carnot died of cholera eight years later, before he could see his efficiency formula develop over the 19th century into the theory of thermodynamics: a set of universal laws dictating the interplay among temperature, heat, work, energy and entropy — a measure of energy’s incessant spreading from more- to less-energetic bodies. The laws of thermodynamics apply not only to steam engines but also to everything else: the sun, black holes, [living beings](https://www.quantamagazine.org/20170126-information-theory-and-the-foundation-of-life/) and the entire universe. The theory is so simple and general that Albert Einstein deemed it likely to “never be overthrown.”

Yet since the beginning, thermodynamics has held a singularly strange status among the theories of nature.

~“If physical theories were people, thermodynamics would be the village witch,” the physicist Lídia del Rio and co-authors [wrote](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.07835.pdf) last year in *Journal of Physics A*. “The other theories find her somewhat odd, somehow different in nature from the rest, yet everyone comes to her for advice, and no one dares to contradict her.”~
