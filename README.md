# bandstands

A [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/) housing [[Bill Anderson]]'s (a.k.a. "band") past and current web and wiki experiments, assorted notes on readings, day-oriented journal and blog entries, and whatever else shows up. The wiki name is shared with a now dormant Tumblr blog, some of whose entries are posted and maintained here.

Use the "Recent Changes", "Search", "All Pages" , and "Random Page" buttons in the sidebar to find your way around.
