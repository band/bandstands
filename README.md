# bandstands

A [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/) housing [[Bill Anderson]]'s (a.k.a. "band") past and current web and wiki experiments, assorted notes on readings, day-oriented journal and blog entries, and whatever else shows up. The wiki name is shared with a now dormant Tumblr blog, some of whose entries are posted and maintained here.

Use the "Recent Pages" sidebar link, and the "Search", "Random Page", and "All Pages" buttons at the top to find your way around.

**Comments welcome!** Click the "<" icon in the upper right to open the Hypothesis annotation/highlights panel.  Sign up or log into Hypothesis in that panel to add comments and annotations to the pages in this wiki.
