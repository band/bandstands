# enchantments

Before science assumed the truth and the way,
And enchantments held their sway,
There was a general--not universal--consensus about
The nature of things.

Now this unseen world of spirits and sprites
Is hidden away.
But the notions of magic,
Potions of the possible,
And thoughts of the uncanny,
Well, they are here to stay.
