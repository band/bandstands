# purity tests

// purity tests: a proven way to end a discussion or conversation /  
// purity testing avoids leaving discussions unresolved /  
// "cleanliness is next to godliness" was once, to me, just a reminder about hygiene, and, oh, cleaning up my messy room /  
// having a binary choice seems to clarify my options, but often I still waver /  
// how about this gem: can ends justify means? and if "yes, they can" does that mean any "by any means necessary"? /  
// and if the answer is "sometimes". well then, how can one determine when? /
