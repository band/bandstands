Hospicing Modernity practice notes

I am reading Hospicing Modernity (HM) and have just finished with the pre-work chapters. And I am trying to follow the instructions on using this book as a workbook to foster my own learning and un-learning. Here are some thoughts generated by the  current conversation:  

Amitav Ghosh, in The Great Derangement, stated one of HM’s primary observations about Modernity/Coloniality (M/C) “... one of modernity's most effective weapons: its insistence that it has rendered other forms of knowledge obsolete.” - page 20: Ghosh, A. (2016). _The Great Derangement: climate change and the unthinkable_. University of Chicago Press."  

my more free-association thoughts:  
/ HM practice is beyond theory //  
/ @PK - yes transformation even beyond transformation //  
/ @Jerry - we are all "Muggles" - yes? //  
/ looking for a story, or stories, that will capture our attention and energy: this is the work of Modernity to save itself //  
/ my personal HM work cannot be about "finding", "searching", or "making sense"; i have to put all that down //
