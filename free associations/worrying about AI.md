# worrying about AI


2024-10-14: 
/- when human intelligence is reduced to machine intelligence, or vice-versa, then perhaps there will be worries for all of us /
/- one current musing:  whatever is happening inside an AI or LLM system that we are referring to as "thinking",-- that is not what I am doing when, before going to sleep, I put my head on my pillow and reflect on the few paragraphs I just finished reading /  
/- is it? /
/- or when I take a walk the next day and think again about enchantment and rationality, and ethics and morals, some ideas that I have been reading and wondering about for some months now /

a couple of excerpts from the last year or so of reading seem _a propos_:

First, this from Marina Warner (1995). *Six myths of our time : little angels, little monsters, beautiful beasts, and more*. Vintage. (Link: <https://search.worldcat.org/en/title/31291493>)   
page 32:  
> ... _Blade Runner_. The film--and the book--touch a live contemporary nerve when they imagine that the robotic monsters look just like humans, that their nature isn't apparent--neither to us, nor to them.
