@lynnfoster and I are talking with some people who call themselves the Driftless Bioregional Foundation.  
The <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driftless_Area> is a bioregion that is increasingly becoming conscious of itself from the viewpoint of social-economic-ecological governance beyond the official US state and county governmental institutions.  
Would you be interested in discussion how such a region might organize and govern itself?
I'm sure similar bioregions exist in other places.
