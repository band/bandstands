# 2022-11-14 Dr Vive - climate change a present threat

Dr. Genevieve Guenther (@DoctorVive): A two-part subtweet:

1. Climate change is not a "looming," but a *present* threat, right now, for billions of people on this planet.

2.  "Buffer mechanisms" do push back against shocks, but #ClimateChange is not a shock. It's a non-linear progression of compounding crises in the context of unravelling planetary systems, ecological & therefore also human. 

Yes, we can act as buffers, but not with this system.
