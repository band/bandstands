# 2022-09-27 Matt K Parker untangle hierarchy from dominance

@realMattKParker: “…we can use culture and ritual to gently untangle [hierarchy] from dominance, and … to interpret formal power as a service function instead of a dictatorship. This frees people up to choose their work based on what makes them feel fulfilled, instead of their perceived status.” https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/1573485665718661120
