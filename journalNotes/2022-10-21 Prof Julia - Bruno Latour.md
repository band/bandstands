# 2022-10-21 Prof Julia - Bruno Latour

Prof Julia 🌍🌹🌱 she/her #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 (@JKSteinberger): I have a confession to make. I never was interested in learning what Bruno Latour had to say, in social science or specifically on ecology, because I was prejudiced against him because of the "Sokal Hoax". For those of you too young to remember 👇👇👇

Prof Julia 🌍🌹🌱 she/her #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 (@JKSteinberger): Coming from a family of physicists, with no time for idiocy, we were all incredibly gleeful about this showing up of the postmodern nonsense. When I read the subsequent book of Sokal and Bricmont, I thought their treatment of Latour was devastating. I know better now.

Prof Julia 🌍🌹🌱 she/her #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 (@JKSteinberger): Since Bruno Latour's passing, I have been trying to educate myself, as usual via talks. These two are particularly good. If you only have time for 1, watch the 2nd. But it helps to watch both.
1. Why Gaia is not the Globe

Prof Julia 🌍🌹🌱 she/her #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 (@JKSteinberger): 2. On not joining the dots

I realise now that Latour is a careful & precise cultivator of that rarest of all cultural and academic qualities: imagination. And we need it so very badly right now.

Prof Julia 🌍🌹🌱 she/her #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 (@JKSteinberger): This is particularly clear, sadly, in the discussion part of the 2nd talk, where the others fall back into old patterns of thought. I envy those of you like @picharbonnier who knew him and read him earlier. I'm catching up ... too late, as usual.

Prof Julia 🌍🌹🌱 she/her #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 (@JKSteinberger): I am wondering if he ever got around to commenting on Graeber & @davidwengrow 's Dawn of Everything, or Robin Wall Kimmerer's Braiding Sweetgrass, or @GhoshAmitav 's Great Derangement.  Because somehow, among these ideas, I am persuaded, is the imagination we desperately need.

David Wengrow (@davidwengrow): @JKSteinberger @GhoshAmitav Yes, Bruno Latour commented enthusiastically on our book for an interview in @lobs on 6/01/22 - that he was able to read it, knowing both he and David are gone, is truly enormous for me.
