# 2023-11-24 my first AI social dream

Last night I had my first social dream about AI.  
/ there were scary and unsettling elements //  
/ my own mind seemed pitted against my own beliefs and desires //  
/ and also against the words and thoughts of my own friends //  
/ a bit of a terrified looking into an abyss //
