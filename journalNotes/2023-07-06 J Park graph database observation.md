Jack Park 2023-07-05 comment on graph databases:  
>   Most everything in the universe can be described as things and their connections; that's a graph,. In theory, graph databases ARE very powerful, but, IMHO, some of them are a bit restrictive in what they allow you to do. Example: connections are frequently topics themselves; most "graph" databases make the ontological commitment that "edges" (connections) are always second-class citizens. That should not be the case and some graph databases, in fact, let you make connections to connections, which, IMHO, is how the world works.

Jack's view here supports the notion that the relationships among the things are where a good deal of meaning and information / knowledge value resides;-- at least that's my opinion.
