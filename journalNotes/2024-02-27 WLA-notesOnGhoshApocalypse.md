# 2024-02-27 WLA notes on Ghosh Apocalypse lecture

 - notes stimulated by conversation with Wendy Elford and leximancer
   analysis of a transcript of AG's talk
 
### find narratives

1. present-day zeitgeist around history ending apocalypse; roots in
   1950s nuclear arms race; current expressions and actions led by
   techno and scientific elites; early basis in the theory of
   evolution and eugenics; and how those who believe in eugenics are
   willing to hasten an apocalypse

2. the differences between catatrophist and gradualists perspectives;
   that catastrophist views are not unsound; the notion that this is a
   bio-political difference based on different relationships between human
   societies and the environment
   
3. the growth of preparations by an elite to withstand and survive an
   apocalyptic event, and restart humanity with a clean slate; the
   delusions on which these survivalist ideas are based; a shared
   blind-spot: that the Western, educated, technology advantaged have
   better chances of surviving the expeteced catastrophes; the
   fragility of the industrialized and terra-formed regions of the Earth

4. the abilities of humanity to avoid annihilation are to be found in the
   remaining indigenous knowledge, practices, and rituals of living
   within the natural world
 
## notes from 2024-02-24:

 - Two notions (among several) that I pick up from this essay are:
   (1) extermination of the weak (eugenics), and the telos of evolution,
   or the natural order of things; and 
   (2) bio-political perspective of the planetary crisis.
   
   In addition are:  
   - the history of evolution and telos,  
   - the techno-scientific and utopian visions of apocalypse,  
   - the delusion that anyone can be insulated from the impacts of planetary crises, and  
   - that the indigenous people, and the least developed regions of
     the Earth, are best suited to adapt to and survive catastrophes.
