# 2022-12-31 a few musings about the year

- in a today-i-learned vein, i finally understand what the "Overton window" is, and think I know how to use it in a sentence, and mean it. Citation: [Ideas Are Weapons: the Overton Window And Fascism](https://resolutesquare.com/articles/6EBBygLTRmkOOYSTtmWBUE/ideas-are-weapons-the-overton-window-and-fascism)  
- also, from today,-- i finally feel brow-beaten (in a reasonable way) into having some interactions with `ChatGPT`, but I am not happy about it. the main push is RP's claim that `ChatGPT` provides better information for certain queries than Google search.  
- after over two years of using Obsidian -- mostly enjoyable and useful -- i still do not have a clear idea of what my PKM (or if it indeed is KM of any kind) practices are, or even what the aims are. one of the BIG Qs: i see what i am doing, but i am not sure what it is for. maybe this next year?  
- i am not sanguine about the socio-political commons and public goods here in my dear USA. and not sure how to manage the sadness.  


- `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
