*We all have helpers in seen and unseen realms.  
Give them something to do.  
Otherwise, they will grow inattentive with boredom.  
They can clean junk from your mind,  
Find the opening note for the chorus of a song,  
Or give a grandchild a safe path through the dark.  
They will not give you winning numbers at the casino,  
Wash your dishes, or take out an enemy.  
Thank them.  
Feed them once in a while.*
